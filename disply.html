    <p><b>Krishna</b> is a major Hindu god. Often called Lord Krishna, he is one of the most widely worshiped and popular Hindu deities. Krishna is the eighth avatar (or incarnation) of Vishnu. He was deified in the 5th century and since then has also been worshiped as the supreme god himself. Krishna is the Hindu god of compassion, protection, and love.

        Also called the Dark One, Krishna is an important character in many Hindu sacred texts, including the Bhagavad Gita. He is portrayed in various ways in Indian mythology and art, from child-god to divine lover, prankster to hero. However, there are three main stages of incarnation within the story of Krishna: the baby, the lover, and the sage. These three stages are believed to symbolize key aspects of his significance and power within Hindu mythology.
        
        Krishna is known by 108 different names and emanations, many of which reflect his attributes and mythological associations. The name Krishna itself means black or dark blue. Some of his more popular epithets are Mohan, the enchanter, Govinda, the chief herdsman, Keev, the prankster. Some epithets and names are used only in specific geographical locations. One example is Jagannatha, a name popular in the Odisha state region of India. The honorary title Sri is often placed before the name Krishna, meaning Lord.

    <p><b>Krishna Kamal In Mythology</b>
        The flowering plant named Krishna Kamal has an interesting structure. While the petals are mostly blue or purple, the five filaments in the middle of the flower are yellowish. These five filaments are said to represent the Pandavas, and a hundred petals around the flower bulb represent the Kauravas. The green bulb connected to the yellow filaments and the purple petals is symbolic of Draupadi. Some theories suggest that the radial elements in the center of the flower represent the Sudarshan Chakra, Lord Krishna’s mightiest weapon. This is also where the plant is believed to get its name.
       
       In Christianity, people believe that the corona of the passion flower plant resembles Jesus’s thorn crown during his crucifixion and symbolizes Christ’s pain.
       
        
       
       Since this plant carries so much importance, it's also subject to specific rules for Vastu plants. Krishna Kamal must be kept towards the east or in the southeast corner of a house for Vastu-related benefits.</p>
